# ðŸ”’ Security Fix Guide - GitHub Push Protection

## âœ… What Was Fixed

All hardcoded Shopify access tokens have been removed from your codebase and replaced with environment variables. Here's what was updated:

### Files Modified:
1. **`xeno-backend/server.js`** - Now uses environment variables for all Shopify tokens
2. **`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** - Updated to use placeholder tokens
3. **`RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** - Updated to use placeholder tokens
4. **`deploy-render-vercel.bat`** - Updated to use placeholder tokens
5. **`deploy-render-vercel.sh`** - Updated to use placeholder tokens
6. **`xeno-backend/render.yaml`** - Updated to use placeholder tokens
7. **`env.example`** - Created with all required environment variables

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. Create Your Local Environment File
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your actual tokens
# Replace the placeholder values with your real Shopify access tokens
```

### 2. Set Your Actual Tokens
Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values:

```bash
# Your actual tokens (replace these with your real tokens)
FASHION_STORE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_fashion_store_token_here
BOOKS_STORE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_books_store_token_here
ELECTRONICS_STORE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_electronics_store_token_here
```

### 3. Commit and Push Your Changes
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Security: Remove hardcoded tokens, use environment variables"

# Push to GitHub (this should now work!)
git push --set-upstream origin fix
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables in Deployment Platforms

#### For Railway:
- Go to your Railway dashboard
- Navigate to your service
- Go to Variables tab
- Add the environment variables from `env.example`

#### For Render:
- Go to your Render dashboard
- Navigate to your service
- Go to Environment tab
- Add the environment variables from `env.example`

#### For Vercel:
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Navigate to your project
- Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
- Add the environment variables from `env.example`

## ðŸ”’ Security Benefits

1. **No More Exposed Tokens**: Your sensitive credentials are no longer in your Git repository
2. **Environment-Specific**: Different tokens for development, staging, and production
3. **Easy Rotation**: Change tokens without modifying code
4. **Team Safety**: Other developers can use their own tokens without conflicts

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Fix

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Start your backend
cd xeno-backend
npm start

# Check if it starts without errors
# The server should warn about missing tokens but still start
```

### Production Testing:
1. Deploy with environment variables set
2. Test the `/health` endpoint
3. Test the `/api/stores` endpoint
4. Test the sync functionality

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - They're already in `.gitignore`
2. **Use different tokens** for different environments
3. **Rotate tokens regularly** for security
4. **Keep tokens secure** - don't share them in chat or email

## ðŸ“ž If You Need Help

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify the token format (should start with `shpat_`)
3. Test the tokens directly with Shopify API
4. Check the server logs for specific error messages
